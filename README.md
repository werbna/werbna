# 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew!  
🌟 Software Engineer | Restaurant Industry Vet | Lifelong Learner 🌟  

### About Me
- 🍽️ **From Culinary to Code**: With years of experience in the restaurant industry—from front of house to back of house—I bring a unique perspective on teamwork, quick problem-solving, and resilience.
- 🗽 **NYC Transplant**: My two years in New York were transformative, sparking a love for working with others and ultimately inspiring my leap into software engineering.

### 🔥 What Drives Me
- I am deeply passionate about developing intuitive, user-centric solutions that simplify daily challenges and enhance quality of life. To me, technology should not only be powerful but also accessible, empowering people to achieve more with less effort. I thrive on the gratification of knowing that the tools I build have a real impact—whether by streamlining tasks, fostering creativity, or just making someone’s day a little easier. Every project is a chance to craft something meaningful that others can rely on.
